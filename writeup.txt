My brute force algorithm is probably 2 theta(n^2), since I technically swap twice per each swap and i do the swap, and the algorithm increases exponentially with size
My iterative repair is probably theta(n), if it worked properly

my brute force ran for approximately 4641451.3 nanoseconds per run, based on 10 runs.
my iterative repair never finished, sorry
